# Endless Sky

Explore other star systems. Earn money by trading, carrying passengers, or completing missions. Use your earnings to buy a better ship or to upgrade the weapons and engines on your current one. Blow up pirates. Take sides in a civil war. Or leave human space behind and hope to find some friendly aliens whose culture is more civilized than your own...

------

Endless Sky is a sandbox-style space exploration game similar to Elite, Escape Velocity, or Star Control. You start out as the captain of a tiny spaceship and can choose what to do from there. The game includes a major plot line and many minor missions, but you can choose whether you want to play through the plot or strike out on your own as a merchant or bounty hunter or explorer.

See the [player's manual](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/wiki/PlayersManual) for more information, or the [home page](https://endless-sky.github.io/) for screenshots and the occasional blog post.

## Building from source
Most development is done on Linux and Windows, using the [SCons](https://scons.org/) build tool to compile the project. For those wishing to use an IDE, project files are provided for [Code::Blocks](https://www.codeblocks.org/) to simplify the project setup. There is also a CMake project available ([build instructions](readme-cmake.md)).

# Contributing
Endless Skies will be a fully transparent fork to the base game Endles Sky. Everything will be openly discussed, and everything that is added to this fork will be voted on. If possible, every addition will be discussed at length and fully agreed upon. This will be a cooperative group effort by the community. 

Endless Sky's main discussion and development area was once [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/g/endless-sky), but due to factors outside our control, it is now inaccessible to new users.
